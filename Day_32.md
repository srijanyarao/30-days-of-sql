# Day 32 – SQL Practice

## Problem Statement
𝐌𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐓𝐫𝐲: Accenture(Medium Level) hashtag#SQL Interview Question — Solution

Following a recent advertising campaign, the marketing department wishes to classify its efforts based on the total number of units sold for each product.

You have been tasked with calculating the total number of units sold for each product and categorizing ad performance based on the following criteria for items sold:

Outstanding: 30+
Satisfactory: 20 - 29
Unsatisfactory: 10 - 19
Poor: 1 - 9

Your output should contain the product ID, total units sold in descending order, and its categorized ad performance.

🔍By solving this, you'll learn how to use when, case and group by. Give it a try and share the output! 👇

CREATE TABLE marketing_campaign (user_id INT,created_at DATETIME,product_id INT,quantity INT,price INT);

INSERT INTO marketing_campaign (user_id, created_at, product_id, quantity, price) VALUES(1, '2020-01-01', 101, 25, 200),(2, '2020-01-01', 102, 5, 150),(3, '2020-01-02', 103, 15, 300),(4, '2020-01-03', 101, 10, 200),(5, '2020-01-04', 102, 22, 150),(6, '2020-01-05', 104, 8, 120),(7, '2020-01-06', 105, 18, 250),(8, '2020-01-07', 101, 30, 200),(9, '2020-01-08', 103, 20, 300),(10, '2020-01-09', 104, 9, 120);

## My Thought Process

This is a grouped aggregation problem where the goal is to roll up total units sold per product and then classify each product based on its sales volume. After summing the quantities, I used a CASE expression to map each product into the correct performance category. Finally, I sorted the results by total units sold so the strongest performers appear first.

In retail analytics, this type of problem falls under campaign performance evaluation—using sales lift to understand how well each product responded to marketing efforts.

## SQL Solution
```sql

SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) as num_of_units_sold,
       CASE 
           WHEN SUM(quantity) >= 30 THEN 'Outstanding'
           WHEN SUM(quantity) BETWEEN 20 AND 29 THEN 'Satisfactory'
           WHEN SUM(quantity) BETWEEN 10 AND 19 THEN 'Unsatisfactory'
           ELSE 'Poor'
        END AS product_performance    
  FROM marketing_campaign
 GROUP BY product_id
 ORDER BY num_of_units_sold DESC;
