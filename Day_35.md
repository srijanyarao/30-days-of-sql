𝐌𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐓𝐫𝐲: Twitter(Hard Level) hashtag#SQL Interview Question — Solution

Find the top three distinct salaries for each department. Output the department name and the top 3 distinct salaries by each department. Order your results alphabetically by department and then by highest salary to lowest.

🔍By solving this, you'll learn how to use CTE, Group By, Having, Case. Give it a try and share the output! 👇

INSERT INTO employees (id, first_name, last_name, age, sex, employee_title, department, salary, target, bonus, city, address, manager_id) VALUES (1, 'Allen', 'Wang', 55, 'F', 'Manager', 'Management', 200000, 0, 300, 'California', '23St', 1),(13, 'Katty', 'Bond', 56, 'F', 'Manager', 'Management', 150000, 0, 300, 'Arizona', NULL, 1),(19, 'George', 'Joe', 50, 'M', 'Manager', 'Management', 100000, 0, 300, 'Florida', '26St', 1),(11, 'Richerd', 'Gear', 57, 'M', 'Manager', 'Management', 250000, 0, 300, 'Alabama', NULL, 1),(10, 'Jennifer', 'Dion', 34, 'F', 'Sales', 'Sales', 100000, 200, 150, 'Alabama', NULL, 13),(18, 'Laila', 'Mark', 26, 'F', 'Sales', 'Sales', 100000, 200, 150,  'Florida', '23St', 11),(20, 'Sarrah', 'Bicky', 31, 'F', 'Senior Sales', 'Sales', 200000, 200, 150, 'Florida', '53St', 19),(21, 'Suzan', 'Lee', 34, 'F', 'Sales', 'Sales', 130000, 200, 150,  'Florida', '56St', 19),(22, 'Mandy', 'John', 31, 'F', 'Sales', 'Sales', 130000, 200, 150,  'Florida', '45St', 19),(17, 'Mick', 'Berry', 44, 'M', 'Senior Sales', 'Sales', 220000, 200, 150, 'Florida', NULL, 11),(12, 'Shandler', 'Bing', 23, 'M', 'Auditor', 'Audit', 110000, 200, 150, 'Arizona', NULL, 11),(14, 'Jason', 'Tom', 23, 'M', 'Auditor', 'Audit', 100000, 200, 150, 'Arizona', NULL, 11),(16, 'Celine', 'Anston', 27, 'F', 'Auditor', 'Audit', 100000, 200, 150, 'Colorado', NULL, 11),(15, 'Michale', 'Jackson', 44, 'F', 'Auditor', 'Audit', 70000, 150, 150, 'Colorado', NULL, 11),(6, 'Molly', 'Sam', 28, 'F', 'Sales', 'Sales', 140000, 100, 150, 'Arizona', '24St', 13),(7, 'Nicky', 'Bat', 33, 'F', 'Sales', 'Sales', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

## My Thought Process

To get the top 3 distinct salaries for each department, I first needed to make sure each salary value inside a department was treated as a unique entry. That meant grouping by both department and salary so duplicates wouldn’t affect the ranking. After that, I used DENSE_RANK() to assign a rank to each salary within its department, since we want each distinct salary to have its own rank even if multiple employees share it. Once the ranks were assigned, I filtered down to the top three and then sorted the final output by department and salary.

This type of problem shows up a lot in retail analytics when you’re ranking products, stores, or categories based on performance metrics. The pattern is the same: group by the right level, rank within that group, and filter to the top N values.

## SQL Solution
```sql
with ranking_departments AS(
   SELECT department, salary,DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS department_rank
     FROM employees2
    WHERE salary IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY department,salary
)
SELECT department,salary
  FROM ranking_departments
 WHERE department_rank <= 3
 ORDER BY department ASC, salary DESC;
