# Day 50 – SQL Practice

## Problem Statement
𝐌𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐓𝐫𝐲: Meta (Hard Level) #SQL Interview Question — Solution

Market penetration is an important metric for Spotify's growth in different regions. As part of the analytics team, calculate the active user penetration rate in specific countries. Active Users must meet these criteria:
Interacted with Spotify within the last 30 days (last_active_date >= 2024-01-01). At least 5 sessions. At least 10 listening hours.

Formula: Active User Penetration Rate = (Number of Active Spotify Users in the Country / Total Users in the Country)
Output: country, active_user_penetration_rate (rounded to 2 decimals).

🔍By solving this, you'll learn how to use Group By and Agg function. Give it a try and share the output! 👇

CREATE TABLE penetration_analysis ( country VARCHAR(20), last_active_date DATETIME, listening_hours BIGINT, sessions BIGINT, user_id BIGINT);

INSERT INTO penetration_analysis (country, last_active_date, listening_hours, sessions, user_id) VALUES ('USA', '2024-01-25', 15, 7, 101), ('USA', '2023-12-20', 5, 3, 102), ('USA', '2024-01-20', 25, 10, 103), ('India', '2024-01-28', 12, 6, 201), ('India', '2023-12-15', 8, 4, 202), ('India', '2024-01-15', 20, 7, 203), ('UK', '2024-01-29', 18, 9, 301), ('UK', '2023-12-30', 9, 4, 302), ('UK', '2024-01-22', 30, 12, 303), ('Canada', '2024-01-01', 11, 6, 401), ('Canada', '2023-11-15', 3, 2, 402), ('Canada', '2024-01-15', 22, 8, 403), ('Germany', '2024-01-10', 14, 7, 501), ('Germany', '2024-01-30', 10, 5, 502), ('Germany', '2024-01-01', 5, 3, 503);

## My Thought Process

I used a CASE expression to flag users who qualify as active based on the three conditions. After that, I counted how many users met the criteria and divided that by the total number of users in each country. Since the calculation is done at the country level, grouping by country gives the final penetration rate.

## SQL Solution
```sql

SELECT country,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE
                    WHEN last_active_date >= 2024-01-01 
                         AND sessions >= 5 
                         AND listening_hours >= 10
                    THEN 1 
                    ELSE 0
            END)* 100.0 / COUNT(*),2) AS active_User_Penetration_Rate
  FROM penetration_analysis
 GROUP BY country;
