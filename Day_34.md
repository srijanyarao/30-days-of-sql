## My Thought Process

This is the kind of problem that shows up a lot in analytics — especially in retail and marketplace environments where you’re ranking products, stores, or listings based on performance metrics. Here, the goal is to identify the top‑rated hotels, so I focused on grouping the data by hotel name and calculating the average reviewer score for each one. After that, it was just a matter of ordering the results by the calculated score and limiting the output to the top three.

## SQL Solution
```sql
SELECT hotel_name, AVG(reviewer_score) AS average_score
  FROM hotel_address
 GROUP BY hotel_name
 ORDER BY average_score DESC
 LIMIT 3;
